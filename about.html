        <p>Hi there, I'm Drake. I'm a big fan of gaming, working out, and quality time with friends and family.
            <br> 
            <br>
            After nearly ten years in the restaurant industry I was ready for a change. So when COVID happened, I took
            the opportunity to pivot carreers. I have recently graduated from General Assembly's remote Software Engineer Immersive bootcamp course.
            It was a rigorous and challenging learning environment and curriculum, but seeing it through to the end was very rewarding.
            It gave me a solid foundation of primarily JavaScript, but we were also introduced to a plethora of different and interesting technologies.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am now seeking my first software engineer position, and I am incredible exciting to see where this new career takes me.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm a quick learner, I value feedback, I communicate well, and I will not give up until my goal or task is complete.
            I am honest, respectful, authentic, and I believe I will be a valuable asset to any team. 
        </p>
